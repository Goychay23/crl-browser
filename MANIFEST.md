This browser is actually developed for the "CRL" network ecosystem. Built on the CRL network base, the browser has its own engine and its own network segment communication structure. For more information, visit the [CRL Manifesto](https://azencompileropensourcefoundation.com/general-crl.manifesto/).
The general purpose of the browser **crl-browser**, which is protected like the eye of the CRL ecosystem, is to offer criminal networking. One of the biggest goals of **crl-browser** is to establish "user privacy and a large customizable ecosystem for users." One of the first parts of this ecosystem is to offer the browser written on [crl-engineering](https://azencompileropensourcefoundation.com/crl-engineering), which was developed for the CRL ecosystem, to the "criminal user ecosystem."

I will explain where the word "criminal" comes from in the date: 20/5/2025 word anyway.
